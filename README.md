### Collecting Health data like heartbeat,i.e ECG from patients directly in Ambulances and transmitting the retrieved data to the nearby Hospital 
### The proposed Arduino-based IoT Patient Monitoring System for Ambulances is designed to address the limitations of existing solutions by offering a low-cost, flexible, and accessible alternative for real-time patient monitoring during emergency transport 

For this we have used development boards like Arduino and ESP82 ..

Modules used in the project

 * sim 800l
 * neo 6s gps module
 * rfid token
 * lm35 temperature
 * Max 30105

we have written code in both c++ and python..
frontend using mathworks software Thing SpeakIOT.

Backend using Django rest-framework

The IOT  modules design has been done by Keerthibalan
Cad models,Frontend and backend has been by Shivash

Team Nothing had been participated in Designation24 at rec and have received awards for the best societal impact project
